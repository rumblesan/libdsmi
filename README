An updated version of libdsmi, a Midi library for Nintendo DS homebrew.


The original library has support for the DSerial cart as well as Midi and OSC messges over wifi.
This version also has support for the DSBrut serial IO cartridge.

This isn't yet extensivly tested so I take no responsibility for borked carts, blown DSes or global nuclear armagedeon.

If it does work for you tho, let me know.
